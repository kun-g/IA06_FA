Research linking network structure with success has been a first generation of work.  That work is well advanced, but far from complete.  I discuss the current position becoming stronger and broader with replication, attention to negative results, and attention to dynamics.  Shifting to an exciting second generation of ongoing work, research has emerged focused on the behavior by which broker advantage is linked with success.  I discuss framing and frame shifts, the importance of personal engagement, the uncertain moderating effects of culture and personality, and a few behavioral variations in brokerage.  I discuss the context dependence of tertius gaudens tactics iungens versus separans, and the distinction between brokers who consume versus produce emotional energy in their colleagues.", 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/SHCCE.pdf'}, {'title': 'Chapter References', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/SHCCE_references.pdf'}]},

When the bridge is adjacent to a closed network, difficulty is likely to escalate into character assassination. Sympathetic gossip within the closed network encourages ego to blame bridge difficulty on the character of the person on the other side of the bridge. We propose a character assassination index, a 'CA index,' measuring the extent to which a person's network increases the odds of him or her blaming difficulty on the character of a specific colleague. The index refines aggregate closure measures used in prior research, and does well in predicting who entrepreneurs cite as their most difficult contact, and predicting which entrepreneurs blame the difficulty on the contact's character (rather than the difficulty of the situation, or the contact's competence).", 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/AE.pdf'}]},

There is also gender pattern in contacts, reflecting conservative attitudes in the broader society:  Women are the object of more interaction on technical matters out of the public eye, while men are the preferred contact for representation (men and women more often cite male contacts for help in founding the business, dealing with suppliers, and dealing with customers).

I take three points from the analysis: (1) In the earlier reports, indicators of business success were aggregated into a summary measure of success based on correlations among the indicators (factor analysis).  When the indicators are aggregated here for their intercorrelation with each other and measures of felt success (canonical correlation analysis), the network-success association observed previously is about the same.  Thus, the prior summary measure of concrete success captured respondent felt success, as intended.  Nothing is gained by weighting the prior measure of success for feelings of success.  (2) For these manufacturing businesses, profitability is a success dimension separate from concrete success indicators such as having many employees, having intellectual property in the form of patents, and enjoying a high level of sales.  Although return on assets, like other indicators of success, has a strong negative association with network closure, return on assets is uncorrelated of the other success indicators considered here.  (3) The two indicators of felt success used here are strongly correlated with each other, and similarly correlated with summary success factors, but they have inconsistent network associations with network structure.  Felt success within society has the usual negative association with network closure observed here and elsewhere for measures of success, however, felt success within the entrepreneur's industry has no network association, raising questions about of the number of dimensions on which people experience the lack of success associated with network closure.", 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/NACFS.pdf'}]},

Felmlee, and Derek Kreager', 'abstract': "It is reasonable to expect the network association with achievement to vary with age such that people at certain ages enjoy more advantage.  This chapter is about that possibility.  I ask three questions:  Are there certain peak periods in a manager's life when network advantage is more valuable?  How are those peak periods visible as transitions in the networks providing advantage?  How is the achievement associated with network advantage contingent on peak periods?  I provide illustrative answers to the questions using data on senior managers in banking, financial services, engineering, human resources, software, and supply chain.  Returns to network advantage vary with manager age.  People of an age within their organization's peak period, relative to people of ages outside the peak period, are a more attractive source of ideas and suggestions such that they enjoy higher returns to network advantage.  Middle-age is peak period in the aggregate, but individual organizations display one of three distinct single-peaked patterns of age contingency: There is an 'Old Valued' pattern in which the peak period is at the end of the career: achievement becomes increasingly linked to network advantage as a person ages. There is an 'Old Devalued' pattern in which the peak period is at the beginning and middle of the career: network advantage is consistently valuable until a person reaches his 50s, after which increasing age sees achievement decreasingly associated with network advantage.  Finally, there is an 'Old and Young Devalued' pattern in which the peak period is during middle age: network advantage is most valuable for middle-age managers, offering little value to young or old managers.  My summary conclusion is that network models of advantage do not need to be re-defined to take peak periods into account, but organization-specific norms about age and aging are a factor to bear in mind when predicting achievement in a specific organization.", 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/LCNA.pdf'}]},

Using network data from a stratified probability sample of 700 entrepreneurs citing 4,664 contacts, we study guanxi relative to other relations to learn how much individual differences such as well-being, business differences, political participation and demographic factors matter for the guanxi distinction.  Two findings stand out: First, the connection between trust and social network is robust to most differences between individuals, especially business and political differences.  Trust variance is 60% network context, and 10% individual differences.  Trust increases within a relationship as network closure increases around the relationship, but some relationships mature into guanxi ties within which trust is high and relatively independent of the surrounding social structure.  Second, when individual differences matter, they concern social isolation.  Guanxi ties are more distinct in the networks around entrepreneurs with small, marginal families, and around those with small, closed networks.  Both categories of entrepreneurs are likely to experience difficulties with respect to resource access and doing business with people beyond their network, which may explain why longstanding guanxi ties linked to important events are particularly distinct for these entrepreneurs.', 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/MLG.pdf'}, {'title': '2012 Network Instrument', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/Network_Instrument2012.pdf'}, {'title': 'Respondent Worksheets for 2012 Network Instrument', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/Network_Instrument_Worksheets2012.pdf'}, {'title': 'DOI 10.1016/j.socnet.2017.12.001', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2017.12.001'}]},

(2) Survival odds are improved if the large, open network around a CEO in 2012 was initially a supportive 'cocoon' closed network when the business was founded.  (3) Both results are contingent on capturing the guanxi ties valuable early in the history of the business.  The two network effects disappear when the network around a CEO is limited to his or her currently valued contacts.

By 'network oscillation' we refer to a period of deep engagement in a group (closure), followed a period of connecting across groups (brokerage), followed by deep engagement, followed by brokering, and so on. For evidence, we distinguish four dimensions to network volatility (churn, variation, trend, and reversals), measure the dimensions with panel data on a population of bankers, then add the volatility measures to models predicting banker compensation from status and structural-hole measures of network advantage.  Network volatility is not associated with performance directly or indirectly -- but for one exception: reversals indicate a banker oscillating between brokerage and closure, and that oscillation strongly enhances the performance association with network advantage (measured by status or access to structural holes).  In fact, network advantage has no association with performance for bankers who maintain stable brokerage or closure.

There is no consistent prediction advantage from incorporating reinforcement in measures of access to structural holes.

On average, achievement is higher in networks that provide more opportunities to broker connections across structural holes.  Individual achievement, however, is contingent on people accepting a would-be network broker as the source of a new idea or practice.  The formal authority of high job rank is a well-known contingency factor.  People in senior ranks are more easily accepted as a source of something new, and so enjoy higher returns to network advantage.  More generally, network status operates as a contingency factor, familiar as Merton\'s "Matthew Effect" in which prominent people receive disproportionate credit for valuable ideas or practice.  Reputation is discussed here as a contingency factor similar in function to network status.  Three virtues follow: (1) Research is more replicable when reputation is studied for what it does rather than what it is.  (2) Relative to status, reputation is a contingency factor less exclusive and rooted in the past.  (3) Network advantage denied for want of positive reputation provides an unobtrusive diagnostic with which difficult people problems in an organization can be addressed in a rigorous, analytical way.', 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/RSCF.pdf'}]},

Subject to a few contingencies, research typically shows a competitive advantage associated with high status and more access to structural holes.  The two concepts emerged from the same research community, but research papers typically report on one or the other concept.  The separation is unfortunate because structural holes and network status in theory describe aspects of the same behavior:  The structural holes to which a person is connected are embedded in a broader organization or market in which would-be brokers are more or less reputable.  High status in the broader context signals a reputation that can make a would-be broker more attractive, more likely to engage opportunities to broker, and allay audience concerns about proposed brokerage.  The implications are correlation and contingency.  Reputable people are more likely to be accepted as brokers, so they should more often be brokers, so there should be a strong correlation between network status and access to structural holes.  The contingency is that benefits associated with access to structural holes should be higher for people of higher status because status improves the odds of successfully brokering connections.  Stated the other way around, benefits associated with status should be higher for people rich in access to structural holes because they have more opportunities to benefit from high status.  We offer illustrative empirical evidence of both implications and conclude that the two variables are closely related in concept and in fact, such that advantage is more clearly revealed when the two variables are analyzed together as complements defining network advantage.', 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/EB.pdf'}]},

For reasons of good data and abundant research, we draw heavily on studies of people in organizations. Advantage is traced to network structure as a proxy for the distribution of variably sticky information in a population.  The network around a person indicates a level of access and control in the distribution.  Advantage is a function of information breadth, timing, and arbitrage.  Advantage is manifest in higher odds of proposing good ideas, more positive evaluations and recognition, higher compensation, and faster promotions.  We discuss frontiers of network advantage contingent on personality, cognition, embeddedness, and dynamics.', 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/SNA.pdf'}]},

The more consistent the role-specific networks, and the more important that consistency is for achievement, the more important agency is for understanding achievement.  Using network, experience, and achievement data on people each playing multiple characters in a virtual world, evidence is presented to support two conclusions:  (1) About a third of network variance is consistent within people across roles.  In other words, people who build a closed network in one role are likely to build a closed network in other roles.  People who build in one role a network rich in access to structural holes, are likely to do the same in other roles.  (2) The network consistent across roles contributes almost nothing to predicting achievement.  Achievement in a role is determined by experience and network specific to the role (about 90% of predicted achievement variance).  The two conclusions are robust across substantively significant differences in the mix of roles combined in a multi-role network (too many roles, difficult combination of roles, or roles played to overlapping audiences).  People tend to build similar networks in the roles they play, but their achievement in a specific role depends on experience in the specific role, and the network they build in the role.', 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/NRPAQ.pdf'}]},

This seemed useful given the growing interest in social network analysis, but the chapter is also written to show that the growing interest is less a novelty than a renewed attack on foundational marketing puzzles with new tools. Much of what the world knows about network effects originated in marketing and consumer research conducted during the golden age of social psychology at places like Columbia University's Bureau for Applied Social Research. Recognition of these conceptual and research foundations is particularly timely as increasingly easy access to thin data on consumers as individuals facilitates an ignorance of the social. In shadow lies the opinion and behavior of other people friends, neighbors, colleagues, and others. Those other people are variably connected in the surrounding social network so as to affect what any one individual can do, what he or she feels obligated to do, and what he or she feels inclined to do. Something about the network around two people makes the opinion and behavior of one contagious for the other, an effect familiar in popular metaphors about word-of-mouth advertising, building the buzz, and viral marketing. My goals in this chapter are to distinguish the socialization and social comparison mechanisms by the network conditions in which they occur, and describe how the mechanisms combine in a predictable way as they generate contagion. Neither mechanism is the whole story at the same time that neither is completely wrong. Socialization turns out to describe the occasional, critical instance of opinion and behavior brokered between groups. Social comparison describes the more frequent instance of interpersonal influence within groups and indifference beyond the group. The only course of action that is clearly wrong is to ignore either one of the two mechanisms. advantage.", 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/SOP.pdf'}]},
    {'title': 'Neighbor Networks, 2010 Oxford University Press', 'abstract': 'Neighbor Networks was published by Oxford University Press in January, 2010. From the front flap: There is a moral to this book, a bit of Confucian wisdom often ignored in social network analysis: "Worry not that no one knows you, seek to be worth knowing." This advice is contrary to the usual social network emphasis on securing relations with well-connected people. Neighbor Networks examines the cases of analysts, bankers, and managers, and finds that rewards, in fact, do go to people with well-connected colleagues. Look around your organization. The individuals doing well tend to be affiliated with well-connected colleagues. However, the advantage obvious to the naked eye is misleading. It disappears when an individual\'s own characteristics are held constant. Well-connected people do not have to affiliate with people who have nothing to offer. This book shows that affiliation with well-connected people adds stability but no advantage to a person\'s own connections. Advantage is concentrated in people who are themselves well connected. This book is a trail of argument and evidence that leads to the conclusion that individuals make a lot of their own network advantage. The social psychology of networks moves to center stage and personal responsibility emerges as a key theme. In the end, the social is affirmed, but with an emphasis on individual agency and the social psychology of networks. The research gives new emphasis to Coleman\'s initial image of social capital as a forcing function for human capital. This book is for academics and researchers of organizational and network studies interested in a new angle on familiar data, and as a supplemental reading in graduate courses on social networks, stratification, or organizations. A variety of research settings are studied, and diverse theoretical perspectives are taken.

Davis', 'abstract': 'This chapter is about balance between brokerage and closure, the two primary mechanisms by which social networks constitute social capital. The balance between brokerage and closure is usually analyzed in terms of where to invoke the mechanisms: maximum advantage occurs when a closed network secures alignment within a team and team members have brokerage networks beyond the team. The balance has also been discussed, though never to my knowledge with benefit of network data, in terms of when to invoke the mechanisms: brokerage and closure are in perpetual cycle as a network duality, mending and undoing one another; brokerage followed by closure, followed by brokerage, and so on. It is misadventure to break the cycle. My purpose in this chapter is to make more explicit the network mechanisms in perpetual cycle. I begin with a quick statement of the two network mechanisms responsible for social capital, offering illustrative evidence, then describe the mechanisms as they came together in a specific management initiative that illustrates a common network-duality failure mode, here discussed as "premature consensus." The moral is that bridging our differences today creates a risk of decimating future growth. Being aware of the risk is a first-line defense encouraging balance between brokerage and closure. More generally, the risk is less with more flexible embedding networks such as competing coalitions or safe-harbor common areas.', 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/NDSC.pdf'}]},

The intuition is a perceived tension between brokers and contacts: If nonredundant sources of information provide the broker's competitive advantage, as is assumed in empirical research on the returns to brokerage, then the broker's contacts have a countervailing advantage as monopoly sources. Advantage versus countervailing advantage is the tension to be resolved. The analysis is interesting in its own right, but it carries a broader significance in addressing a critical juncture for network models of advantage. Empirical success in predicting performance with network models has far outstripped our understanding of the way information flow in networks is responsible for network effects. The five and a half assumptions that define RZ's analysis warrant attention as a template for agent-based models of the information mechanism responsible for the broker's advantage. RZ's analysis is almost robust over likely alternatives to their assumptions. I expect less broker-contact tension with alternative capacity and channel assumptions but the tension does not go away. In fact, the tension is more severe than RZ describe if information is distributed in the clustered way typically assumed in research on network brokerage. However, with likely alternative transmission or pricing assumptions, the broker-contact tension can be eliminated, to the broker's advantage.", 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/ISH.pdf'}]},

Given the value of bridging structural holes, is there value to being affiliated with people or organizations that bridge structural holes? The answer is 'no' according to performance associations with manager networks, which creates a problem for consistent network theory across micro to macro levels of analysis. The purpose here is to align manager evidence with corresponding macro evidence on the supplier and customer networks around four-digit manufacturing industries in the 1987 and 1992 benchmark input-output tables. I begin with illustrative evidence on manager networks, to establish a baseline and to explain why direct and indirect access to structural holes can be an advantage. Direct access refers to structural holes in the immediate network of a manager's colleagues, or an industry's suppliers and customers. Indirect access refers to structural holes between friends of friends, in the networks around colleagues, or around suppliers and customers. I then describe the analogous industry network model, introducing the industry data (two years of benchmark performance and network data on detailed American manufacturing industries), and highlighting complementarities between the manager and industry evidence (consistency across levels of analysis, greater variety in manager networks, less endogeneity in the industry networks). Third, I introduce the evidence on industry performance and indirect access to structural holes. In contrast to the manager evidence, about 24% of the industry-structure effect on industry performance can be attributed to structure beyond the industry's own buying and selling, to networks around the industry's suppliers and customers. However, the industry evidence is not qualitatively distinct from the manager evidence so much as it describes a more extreme business environment.", 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/IPIASH.pdf'}, {'title': 'Download Appendix', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/IPIASH_APP.pdf'}]},

Yet popular understanding continues to be based on anecdotes and platitudes in which positive reputations are the reward for good work and good behavior, while negative reputations are retribution for poor work and bad behavior. In fact, reputations emerge not from what we do, but from people talking about what we do. It is the positive and negative stories exchanged about you, the gossip about you, that defines your reputation. Accuracy is a nicety more than a requirement for the stories. What circulates depends on the interests of people doing the circulation, which empowers gossip with its sociologically interesting effect on reputation. This chapter is an introduction to the way that gossip defines reputation, describing the importance of closed networks to the benefits of reputation, and the pathology of networks left closed too long.', 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/GRf.pdf'}, {'title': 'Download English Version', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/GR.pdf'}]},
    {'title': '"Closure and Stability: Persistent Reputation and Enduring Relations among Bankers and Analysts," In 2007 Russell Sage Foundation book, The Missing Links: Formation and Decay in Economic Networks, edited by James E. Rauch', 'abstract': 'As the network around a set of people closes, it provides a competitive advantage known as social capital. Reputation is the mechanism responsible. Closed networks create a reputation cost for inappropriate behavior. With a reputation cost for inappropriate opinions and behavior, trust is less risky within the network, people are self-aligning to shared goals, and production efficiencies result from donated labor and the speed with which tasks can be completed. Stability is critical to the argument. For closure\'s reputation mechanism to have its salutary effects, there has to be a credible threat that reputation will survive to affect future relationships. If reputation were to begin anew with each project there would be no reputation cost to proscribed behavior. I draw three conclusions from four years of data on colleague networks around bankers and analysts in a large financial organization: (1) Reputation stability increases quickly with closure. I find that reputation has no stability from one year to the next in networks of colleagues who have little contact with one another. However and this is an intriguing parallel to the social conformity induced by four peers in Asch\'s (1951) classic laboratory experiment do the same work when you have four mutual contacts with colleagues, and reputation this year is a good predictor of reputation next year. With respect to the people studied here, Coleman (1988:S107) had it exactly right when he said:"Reputation cannot arise in an open structure." (2) Closure\'s stability effect is concentrated in new relationships. Closure is associated with more positive relations and relations are more robust to decay when embedded in closed networks. However, by the third year of a relationship, closure is less important than the strength of the relationship that has built up between the two people. In other words, closure keeps people in new relations longer than they would stay otherwise, thus protecting new relations from decay. (3) Closure\'s stabilizing effect operates at a distance from the stabilized network element. Closure among direct contacts, and closure among indirect contacts (friends of friends), make independent and statistically significant contributions to stability. My summary conclusion is that closure creates an endogenous force for the status quo that secures and expands the boundary around a network, protecting new relations until they are self-sustaining, and doing so even for people only indirectly connected at the periphery of the network.', 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/C&S.pdf'}]},

Lower-level training often has concrete outcomes because the training is intended to make a known process more efficient reduce the number of defective parts, increase the number of units shipped, or reduce the number of customer complaints. The goals of executive education programs are typically less concrete, less about refining what exists than creating what does not yet exist. A typical goal is to improve the informal network of collaborative relations among senior people so they are better aligned with company strategy and better able to quickly detect and pursue market opportunities consistent with the strategy. This paper is about the evaluation of such a program, one grounded in the network structure of social capital. There is abundant cross-sectional evidence on the performance correlates of social capital. Corroborating that evidence, we run a field experiment in which executives educated in the network structure of social capital show performance improvement relative to a control group of untrained, but otherwise equally able peers: Program graduates are 36% to 42% more likely to receive top performance evaluations, 43% to 72% more likely to be promoted (an effect that builds in the two years following the program), and 42% to 74% more likely to be retained by the Company.

This paper is about brokerage among direct versus indirect contacts. Information moved between direct contacts I discuss as direct brokerage, to distinguish it from information moved between friends of friends (people to whom one is only connected indirectly), which I discuss as second-hand brokerage. Analyzing network associations with performance in three study populations, I find that second-hand brokerage has little or no value in a wide variety of circumstances. Brokerage benefits are dramatically concentrated in the immediate network around a person. Why that is so, and conditions under which it is more or less so, are the subjects of this paper. The implication for research design is that brokerage can be measured using designs in which data are limited to the immediate network around an individual. The theory implication is that the social capital of brokerage is a local phenomenon as in the Austrian market metaphor with its emphasis on tacit knowledge about local norms and practice.', 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/SHB.pdf'}]},

The average board of directors contains nine or ten people, so about 15,000 directorships held by 12,000 individuals are observed each year (one individual can sit on more than one board).

At the other extreme, companies in the manufacture and distribution of durable goods have disproportionate numbers of interlocking directors.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                (6) My final point is the regional pattern to the interlocks. When directors interlock company boards, they connect the geographic places in which company headquarters are located. There are three regional patterns to the interlocks: First, interlocks are concentrated in central cities (Dooley, 1969; Allen, 1974). Second, there is a strong preference for directors from one\'s own region (Kono et al., 1998). Local elites play more prominent board roles, the odds of an interlock decrease with geographic distance between two companies, and interlocks are concentrated within regional categories. Third, again holding constant regional differences in interlock volume, each region prefers directors from certain other regions such that there is a geographic interlock network (Table 11, Figure 8). The network reflects historical boundaries in the United States, with a cluster of connected areas in the former Confederate states, an array of connected areas in the former Union states, and a cluster of areas in the former Western territories. The Southern Cluster is largely segregated from the rest of the country except for a brokerage port through St. Louis. The Northern Cluster is anchored on a cohesive East Coast subcluster, itself anchored on New York City, surrounded by a balkanized Midwest. The Western Cluster is anchored on a cohesive West Coast subcluster, itself anchored on Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area, with satellites Houston, Dallas Fort Worth, and the Mountain States. The regional clusters are held together by four network bridges: St. Louis is a port out of the Southern Cluster, a port anchored on strong connection between SBC Communications and Anheuser-Busch. New York City is a broadly-connected port to locations in the Northern and Western Clusters. The East and West Coasts are connected by a bridge of links between technology companies in Boston and San Francisco. Fourth, there is a network bridge between Los Angeles and the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul anchored in industrial and consumer-goods companies.', 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/IDS&P.pdf'}]},

Opinion and behavior are more homogenous within than between groups, so people connected across groups are more familiar with alternative ways of thinking and behaving, which gives them more options to select and synthesize from alternatives. Like over-the-horizon radar in an airplane, or an MRI in a medical procedure, brokerage across the structural holes between groups provides a vision of options otherwise unseen. That vision advantage in detecting and developing good ideas is the mechanism by which brokerage becomes social capital. Where brokerage is social capital, in other words, there should be evidence of brokerage associated with good ideas, and vice versa. I review anecdotal and aggregate evidence consistent with the hypothesis, then look at the discussion networks around individual managers in a large American electronics company. The organization is rife with structural holes and brokerage has its expected correlates: Compensation, positive performance evaluations, promotions, and good ideas are disproportionately in the hands of people whose networks span structural holes. These brokers between groups in the organization are more likely to express their ideas, less likely to have their ideas dismissed, and more likely to have their ideas evaluated as valuable.

We use a network model to describe the association between performance and the dual structure of American markets from 1963 to 1992. (2) We reverse-engineer the network model to infer the "effective" level of competition among producers in each market. Effective competition, a measure of competitive intensity, is inferred from observed market profits predicted by the market network of dependence on other sectors of the economy. Producers with profit margins higher than expected from observed market structure must face an "effective" level of competition lower than the level implied by the observed structure. Instead of predicting performance from internal and external market structure, we use data on performance and external structure (the more reliable and detailed data) to infer internal structure. (3) We demonstrate the research value of the effective competition variable for its reliability (illustrated by automatic adjustment for the exogenous shock of imports in 1982), its accuracy (illustrated by revealing the contingent value of a strong corporate culture in Kotter and Heskett\'s, 1992, study), and as a market factor integrating case with comparative research.

Behavioral data corroborate the network data in that alumnae measured to be more attached are more likely to have joined an alumni club and made a financial contribution to the school. The hypothesis is that alumnae attachment will decay over time, more slowly when the school is deeply embedded in an alumna's network, more quickly when disruptive events compete for the alumna's time and energy. As expected, attachment declines across the years after graduation (linearly for the first twenty years to about half its initial level), and decay is inhibited when connections with GSB graduates are embedded in stable relations of family, work, or long-term friendship. Decay is remarkably robust to events after graduation (which account for 2% of explained variance in attachment). In other words, an alumna's attachment today was largely determined while she was in school.

Rauch', 'abstract': 'Trust remains an unresolved concern in network models of social capital. The social capital of brokerage depends on trust since the value created by brokers by definition involves new, and so incompletely understood, combinations of previously disconnected ideas, but trust is often argued to require network closure, precisely the condition that brokers rise above. My purpose in this paper is to show how the trust association with network closure is more complex, and decidedly less salutary, than argued in closure models of social capital. Building on earlier work, my argument is framed with respect to two hypotheses describing how closure affects the flow of information in a network. What I will discuss as a bandwidth hypothesis (presumed in closure models of social capital and in related work such as models of reputation in economics) says that network closure enhances information flow. The echo hypothesis (based on the social psychology of selective disclosure in informal conversations) says that closed networks do not enhance information flow so much as they create an echo that reinforces predispositions. Information obtained in casual conversations is more redundant than personal experience but not properly discounted, which creates an erroneous sense of certainty. Interpersonal evaluations are amplifed to positive and negative extremes. Favorable opinion is amplified into trust. Doubt is amplified into distrust. I introduce a baseline model in Section 1 describing an etiology for trust ignoring social context. The bandwidth and echo hypotheses are introduced as contextual extensions of the baseline model in Section 2. In Section 3, I use network data on three study populations to illustrate contradiction between the hypotheses and empirical support for echo over bandwidth. My summary conclusion, in Section 4, is that network closure does not facilitate trust so much as it amplifies predispositions, creating a structural arthritis in which people cannot learn what they do not already know.', 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/B&E.pdf'}]}, {'title': '"Structural Holes versus Network Closure as Social Capital," In 2001 Aldine de Gruyter book, Social Capital: Theory and Research, edited by Nan Lin, Karen S.

The closure argument is that social capital is created by a network of strongly interconnected elements.

I draw from a comprehensive review elsewhere ("The network structure of social capital") to support two points in this chapter: there is replicated empirical evidence on the social capital of structural holes, and the contradiction between network closure and structural holes can be resolved in a more general network model of social capital.

In addition to conclusions about specific aspects of theory and research, my summary points are three: (1) Metaphor versus Mechanism. More than one network mechanism can be cited as responsible the competitive advantage known as social capital. The two mechanisms most often cited are protection within closed networks and brokerage across structural holes, but there are others around which future work will emerge if social capital continues to be such a popular metaphor. My first point is that research and theory will better cumulate across studies if we focus on the network mechanisms responsible for social capital effects rather than trying to integrate across metaphors of social capital loosely tied to distant empirical indicators. (2) Evidence. There is an impressive diversity of empirical evidence showing that social capital is more a function of brokerage across structural holes than closure within a network, but there are contingency factors. Research can be expected to yield wildly inconsistent results across studies that ignore the structure of relations among contacts, content distinctions between kinds of relations, numbers of peers, task uncertainty, or the distinction between insiders and outsiders. (3) Complementarity. The two leading network mechanisms can be brought together in a productive way within a more general model of social capital. Closure can be a significant contingency factor for the value of brokerage. Structural holes are the source of value added, but network closure can be essential to realizing the value buried in the holes.

People comfortable with knowing their place in a chain of bureaucratic control could be uncomfortable with the negotiated control exercised by network entrepreneurs, so the positive association between structural holes and performance in the United States could be negligible or even reversed for French managers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                We use network and performance data on two study populations of senior managers, one in France and one in the United States, to describe social capital similarities and differences between the populations. The network form of social capital is similar in the two populations: More successful French managers, like Americans, tend to have networks rich in structural holes. The French and American managers make similar distinctions between kinds of relationships. Relations that bridge structural holes are similarly detached from routine work activities for the French and the Americans. The interesting difference is that social capital develops differently in the two populations. The French managers operate with a less porous social boundary around their firm and associate negative emotions with bridge relations. Reinforcing Aix-en-Provence observations on the significance of adult education for Franco-German differences in organization, we find that exposure to peers in other firms via executive education is for our French managers the only factor positively associated with the social capital of bridge relationships.', 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/SCFAM.pdf'}]}, {'title': '"Decay Functions," May 2000 Social Networks', 'abstract': 'The tendency for relationships to weaken and disappear I discuss as decay, and functions describing the rate of decay over time I discuss as decay functions. Three conclusions are supported with four years of network data on a study population of bankers and their colleagues in a financial organization. (1) Factors known from cross-sectional evidence to be associated with strong relationships are associated with slow decay; decay is slower in relations between colleagues with a strong prior relationship (inertia), working in the same corporate division (homophily), prominent in the social hierarchy of bankers (status), or connected indirectly through many third parties (embedding). (2) Regardless of slower decay in certain relations, decay has a pattern over time similar to the population ecology "liability of newness" attributed to selection and learning, with the added complication of networks and people aging simultaneously. Decay is a power function of time in which the probability of decay decreases with tie age (years for which a relationship has existed) and node age (years for which a banker has been in the study population). (3) Embedding stability is reponsible for the greater stability of older relationships. The decay-inhibiting effects of age occur where embedding is disrupted but not where embedding is continuous.

My baseline is Axelrod's results with TIT for TAT showing that cooperation can emerge as the dominant form of interaction even in a society of selfish individuals without central authority. I replicate Axelrod's results, then show that the results only occur in a rare social context, viz., maximum density networks. Where people form less dense networks by withdrawing from unproductive relationships, as is typical in organizations, the competitive advantage shifts from TIT for TAT to abusive strategies. A devious PUSHY strategy wins in moderate to high density networks. A blatantly HOSTILE strategy wins in less dense networks. Abusive players do well in sparse networks because their abuse is lucrative in the initial exchanges of a relationship, before the other person knows to withdraw. Wise players avoiding the abusive players leaves the abusive players free to concentrate on naive players (con men thrive in big cities). The implication is that what keeps abusive players at bay are friends and acquaintances warning managers away from people known to exploit their colleagues. I reinforce the point with illustrative survey data to conclude that private games are not only too dangerous, but also too rare and too slow to be the foundation for trust within organizations.

Valid distinctions between industries are therefore a critical exogenous factor affecting the quality of organization research. The market boundaries around an industry are defined in theory by the network concept of structural equivalence: products are in the same market to the extent that their production involves purchases from the same supplier markets and sales to the same customer markets. I apply the structural equivalence criterion to detailed transaction data from the U.S. Department of Commerce and get three results: (1) The analysis yields a partition of the American economy into 123 industries (versus the 77 distinguished by Commerce before 1987, and the 88 thereafter), showing where product distinctions are negligible, and where distinctions between structurally nonequivalent kinds of products are needed. (2) Market boundaries are defined less by the homogeneity of transaction patterns within industries, than by differences between industries. Many industries contain products that are structurally nonequivalent with respect to an important supplier or customer transaction. (3) Nevertheless, the proposed partition into 123 industries promises stronger results for organization research because transaction patterns are more equivalent within the proposed industries (more reliable market boundaries), and performance differences are more between than within the proposed industries (market boundaries with higher construct validity).

Firms gain by being able to identify, and adapt more readily to, needed production changes and market shifts.  Managers face new costs.  Coordination costs once borne by corporate bureaucracy Ñ each person having responsibility for coordination within a limited domain of responsibility Ñ are now borne by individual managers who have responsibility for coordination across broader domains, with a corresponding increase in uncertainty, stress, and potentially disruptive conflict.  Enter social capital.  The shift away from bureaucracy is a shift to social capital as the medium for coordination within the organization.

Each status is a unique pattern of relations with kin of specific ages, spouses of specific ages, and friends and coworkers of specific ages.

There is a steep, linear decline in relationship strength ncross the first people cited as discussion partners and a slower, but continuing decline, across the fourth and fifth people cited. Order effects on closeness and contact frequency are described in the comext of network size and relation content. There is a kinship bias only in deciding who to name first: spouses tended to be the first discussion partner cited and other kin tended not to be. There is a sex homophily bias across all respondents - people of one's own sex were cited as discussion partners before members of the opposite sex - but it emerged differently for men and women. Women, especially married women, expressed sex bias in the people with whom they spent time while men expressed sex bias in the people with whom they felt close. Men claimed closer relations with women thnn men but in fact listed their important discussion partners in descending order of closeness and began the list with the names of other men. Finally, there is evidence of a co-worker bias in discussion relations beyond the family; respondents tended to mention co-workers as daily contacts but late in their list of important discussion partners. With the exception of the spouse bias, all evidence of contenl bias is markedly wenker than the consistent tendency for respondents IO list discussion relations in descending order of closeness and contact frequency.", 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/86SN.pdf'}]}, {'title': '"A Note on Scaling the General Social Survey Network Item Response Categories," December 1986 Social Networks', 'abstract': 'The idea of structural balance is used to suggest quantitative intervals between relationship strength response categories in the GSS network data.

These ad hoc distinctions among relation contents increase the likelihood of equivocal research conclusions. We develop three ideas indicating how standard, well-known, network models of relationship form can be used to clarify relationship content. (a) We begin with an idea for recovering the semantic context in which a relation content occurs. This context is cast as a network of tendencies for contents to be confused for one another and the form of the network dissected with network models of relation form holds insights into the ways in which relation contents are understood in a study population. (b) The network concept of structural equivalence is used to define content domains composed of specific relation contents that are substitutable for one another in described relationships. (c) The network concept of network prominence is used to define the ambiguity of contents in described relationships. The proposed perspective is analogous to a linguistic componential analysis of relation content.', 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/85SSR.pdf'}]}, {'title': '"Network Items and the General Social Survey," December 1984 Social Networks', 'abstract': 'This is an argument for obtaining network data in the General Social Survey (GSS).

The strength of this cooptive relation is predicted from a network definition of the extent to which corporations in an economic sector have a market incentive to institutionalize their relations with people as consumers.  As predicted, the proportion of corporate net income donated to charity covaries with the extent to which firms in a sector are dependent on consumption by people and able to do something about eliminating uncertainty in the demand for their product.  In fact, the specified structural effect of the market on the rate of corporate giving is stronger than the income and tax incentive effects typically specified in a microeconomic model.  Methodologically, the discussion illustrates a strategy by which network analysis is often used to inform analyses of individuals: social context constraints on an actor are captured in a network model of context, then specified as parameters in a microeconomic decision model.', 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/83SF.pdf'}]}, {'title': '"Studying status/role-sets as ersatz network positions in mass surveys," February 1981 Sociological Methods & Research', 'abstract': 'A method is described for interviewing a random sample of persons drawn from a large population so as to describe role-sets defining statuses in the population social structure.  The key to the method is a connection between the concept of an actorÕs network position in social structure and combinations of attributes that define statuses in the social structure.  With data obtained in a survey interview with a randomly selected respondent, it is possible to describe the relational pattern defining his Òersatz network positionÓ in the population social structure.

S. Burt, K. P. Christman and Harold C. Kilburn Jr., October 1980 American Sociological Review', 'abstract': 'Moving away from description of directorate ties as a cooptive device, we test a theory explicitly predicting cooptive uses of corporate directorates from the structure of the market in which firms operate.  The theory is based on a network model of structural autonomy.  It takes as exogenous information the sales and purchase transactions between establishments in sectors of the economy, locates those sectors most constraining pricing discretion within each sector, then predicts where establishments should be connected by interorganizational relations as directorate ties (establishments connected through corporate boards by ownership, direct interlocking, or indirect financial interlocking) in the 1967 American economy, we find the theoryÕs predictions to be accurate.  Each of the three types of directorate ties tends to occur where there is market constraint, and tends not to occur in the absence of constraint.  Further, the three types of ties are coordinated as multiplex directorate ties.  Where establishments in one sector constrain those in another, there is a strong tendency for all three types of directorate ties to exist between the two sectors.  Where there is no such constraint, all three tend to be absent.  Support is weaker for intrasector in comparison to intersector cooptation.  Whatever the cooptive intent of the directorate ties described, they are patterned as if they were intended to coopt market constraints on corporate pricing discretion.', 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/80ASR.pdf'}]}, {'title': '"Autonomy in a social topology," January 1980 American Journal of Sociology', 'abstract': 'My purpose here is to define and illustrate a concept of structural autonomy based on recent developments in network analysis.  The concept is stated in terms of the pattern of relations defining a network position.  It incorporates aspects of oligopoly from economics and group-affiliation from sociology.  Eight hypotheses are derived from the proposed concept.  The hypotheses concern the effects on autonomy from the pattern of relations defining a network position, the places in social structure where cooptive relations should appear (as well as places where they should not), and the increase in autonomy that can be expected from effective cooptation.  Numerical illustration is provided.  As a useful research site, firms in manufacturing industries in the 1967 American economy are treated as structurally equivalent actors, and total industry profits take to be a result of relative autonomy across industries.  As expected, the industries with high structural autonomy tend to have high profits, and firms tend to merge with other firms so as to coopt constraints on industry autonomy.', 'links': [{'title': 'Download Paper', 'url': 'https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/ronald.burt/research/files/80AJS.pdf'}]}, {'title': '"Positions in networks," September 1976 Social Forces', 'abstract': 'The existence of an actor as a set of asymmetric relations to and from eveyr actor in a network is specified as the position of the actor in the network.
